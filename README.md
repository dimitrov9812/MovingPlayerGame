# MovingPlayerGame
A simple console name where i use loops to draw on the console and create charachter movement.

  Description of the project:
 - This is simple console game wich starts with a menu where you choose what you want to do (Play,Settings or Exit).
 - In play mode you start in a top left corner of a grid and your mission is to collect the $ and avoid the enemy wich moves towards you.
 - When you collect the $ or so called coins you are updated how many you have and also at the end of each game you can see your highscore.
 - Every time when you die you loose 1 of your lives and when you reach 0 lives the game ends.
 - Each level is with a different size of the map.
 - In the settings you can choose background and foreground color of the console.

 
  What i've learned:
  - I improved my skills of undersanding of how nested loops work.
  - Better understanding of creating and calling methods.
  - Also learned a bit more about nested switch cases and if statements.
  
  What i can do in future to update it:
  - I can try to save the highscores in notepad file.
  - Then display the data from that file on the console when selected from the menu.
  - Character and enemy look select.
